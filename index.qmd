Welcome to **T20 Analytics**, a lightweight site generated from the data pipeline in this repo.

- Use the [Players](players.qmd) page for sortable leaderboards and to click through to player spotlights.
- The [Leagues](leagues.qmd) page will house summaries and coverage by competition.
- Player-specific dashboards live in player/ and pull from the CSVs in data/derived/.

To rebuild the numbers, run your R script (3-02-2026/R Package.R) so it refreshes data/derived, then run quarto render here.
